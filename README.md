# 🌍 Energy Data Visualization Project

## 📖 Project Description
The idea behind this project was to create a concise data analysis in the energy domain that could showcase my ability to extract insights and narrate a compelling story. The focus is on exploring the relationship between **CO₂ emissions**, **economic well-being**, and the **type of energy used to generate electricity** across different regions of the world over various time periods.

## 📊 Visual Storytelling
The visual narrative was designed as a step-by-step journey:

1. **Global CO₂ Trend (Scatterplot)**  
   The story begins by showing the global temporal trend of CO₂ emissions. Over the last 50 years, emissions have grown significantly, which is highlighted through a scatterplot.

2. **1974 vs 2024 Emissions (Barplot)**  
   Next, the narrative compares emissions between 1974 and 2024. A barplot illustrates which continents have increased their emissions and which have managed to reduce them.

3. **Emissions vs Economic Growth (Scatterplot)**  
   Since fossil fuels often drive faster economic growth compared to renewables, the question arises: is there a trade-off in terms of wealth when choosing renewables?  
   To explore this, a scatterplot correlates **total emissions** with **GDP per capita**, first at the continental level and then in more detail by geographic area. This visualization demonstrates that regions relying on renewables can still achieve positive economic well-being.

4. **Ranking Renewable Usage (Horizontal Barplot)**  
   The narrative continues with a horizontal bar chart ranking regions by their share of renewable energy usage, offering a clear comparative view.

5. **Asia vs Europe Energy Mix (Pie Chart)**  
   Finally, the story concludes with a pie chart comparing the electricity generation sources in Asia and Europe, highlighting the differences in energy mix.

## 🛠️ Methodologies & Skills
Throughout the project, I applied a range of data analysis and visualization skills:

- **Data Processing & Cleaning**  
  - Used **pandas** and **numpy** to filter, clean, and aggregate datasets.  
  - Used **pandasql** to perform some queries and show my abilites in SQL.

- **Data Visualization**  
  - Created interactive and didactic visualizations using **Plotly**.

- **AI-Assisted Attributes**  
  - Disclaimer: For certain graphical attributes, I used AI to identify key parameters. However, the overall work was consciously designed and executed by me, ensuring that AI was used responsibly and purposefully.

## 📂 Datasets
The datasets used in this project come from **trusted sources** and were integrated to maintain coherence in both narrative and visualization:

- **Country Codes Dataset**  
  [ISO-3166 Country Codes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes/master/all/all.csv)

- **Annual CO₂ Emissions per Country (OWID)**  
  [Annual CO₂ Emissions Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country.csv?v=1&csvType=full&useColumnShortNames=true)

- **GDP per Capita (World Bank via OWID)**  
  [GDP per Capita Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank.csv?v=1&csvType=full&useColumnShortNames=true)

- **Electricity Generation by Source (OWID)**  
  [Electricity Generation by Source Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-elec-by-source.csv?v=1&csvType=full&useColumnShortNames=true)

These datasets were carefully selected and combined to ensure a coherent and impactful storytelling experience.
